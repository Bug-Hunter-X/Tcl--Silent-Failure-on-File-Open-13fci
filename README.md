# Tcl Silent File Open Error

This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle error in Tcl scripts: silently failing to handle file opening errors.

The `bug.tcl` file contains a procedure `get_data` that attempts to open and read a file.  If the file does not exist, the `open` command returns -1, but this is not properly checked.  The script proceeds, leading to unexpected behavior (likely a crash or an empty string) rather than a clear error message.

The `bugSolution.tcl` file shows how to correctly handle potential errors using Tcl's error handling mechanisms.  It checks the return value of the `open` command and returns an error if needed.
